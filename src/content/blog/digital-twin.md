## What is a Digital Twin?

A **digital twin** is a virtual representation of a physical object, process, or system that serves as its real-time digital counterpart. Think of it as a bridge between the physical and digital worlds.

> "A digital twin is a living model that drives business outcomes." - Michael Grieves, NASA researcher who first proposed the concept

## Key Components of Digital Twins

1. **Physical Entity**: The real-world object being mirrored
2. **Virtual Entity Model**: The digital representation
3. **Data Connection**: Real-time data flow between physical and digital
