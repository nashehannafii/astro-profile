# Understanding NFTs — Standards, Marketplaces, and Impact

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) represent unique digital assets on a blockchain. Unlike fungible tokens (e.g., ETH, BTC), each NFT is distinct and can represent ownership or provenance of art, collectibles, virtual land, and more.

This post covers the technical standards, popular marketplaces, common use-cases, security considerations, and environmental/societal impacts — with curated sources for further reading.

## What makes an NFT unique?

An NFT is typically a smart contract token that includes a unique identifier and metadata pointing to off-chain content (images, audio, 3D models). The token's uniqueness and ownership are tracked on-chain.

Key points:

- **Identifier**: each NFT has a token ID and contract address that together uniquely identify it on-chain.
- **Metadata**: JSON metadata typically lives off-chain (IPFS, centralized URLs) and includes attributes like name, description, and media URL.
- **Provenance**: the blockchain ledger records transfers, enabling provenance and ownership history.

## Standards: ERC-721 and ERC-1155

- **ERC-721**: the original Ethereum standard for NFTs. Each token is unique and ownership is tracked per token ID. Read the spec: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721
- **ERC-1155**: a multi-token standard that supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single contract, optimizing batch transfers and gas: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155

Other standards and metadata schemas:

- **Metadata JSON** (example schema used by OpenSea): https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards
- **IPFS** for hosting content: https://ipfs.io/

## Marketplaces and platforms

- **OpenSea** — one of the largest NFT marketplaces: https://opensea.io/
- **Rarible** — community-owned marketplace: https://rarible.com/
- **Nifty Gateway** — curated drops platform: https://niftygateway.com/
- **Foundation** — creator-focused marketplace: https://foundation.app/

For creators: most marketplaces provide guides for minting and listing NFTs. Marketplaces often index metadata and provide royalties support (marketplace-enforced or off-chain).

## Practical uses and examples

- Digital art and collectibles (CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club)
- In-game assets and virtual goods
- Domain names (ENS: https://ens.domains/)
- Tickets and access passes
- Tokenized real-world assets and fractional ownership

## Security and best practices

- **Metadata immutability**: host critical metadata on IPFS or make sure metadata URLs are immutable to avoid content swaps.
- **Royalties**: royalties often rely on marketplace enforcement; on-chain royalty enforcement is an active area of research.
- **Smart contract safety**: reuse audited libraries (OpenZeppelin), avoid untrusted external calls in minting flows, and test thoroughly.
- **Watch for scams and phishing**: many exploits target wallets (malicious approvals, fake minting sites).

## Environmental and societal impacts

NFTs received attention for environmental concerns because older blockchains (like Ethereum pre-Merge) used energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW). Since the Ethereum Merge to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), energy usage dropped dramatically for ETH chain.

Articles and analyses:

- "NFTs and energy consumption" — The Guardian overview (archived discussions): https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/18/nft-carbon-footprint-explainer
- "Ethereum Merge" energy impact (Ethereum Foundation): https://ethereum.org/en/merge/
- Academic discussion of environmental impact and tradeoffs: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01066

Societal considerations:

- **Copyright & ownership**: owning an NFT does not necessarily confer copyright — often it represents a tokenized pointer to media.
- **Accessibility**: high gas fees and marketplaces can create barriers for creators and collectors.

## How to get started (for creators)

1. Choose a chain and marketplace. Consider fees, audience, and environmental preferences (e.g., Polygon, Solana, ImmutableX).
2. Prepare your artwork and metadata; pin to IPFS (Pinata, nft.storage).
3. Use marketplace minting or deploy your own contract (OpenZeppelin templates) and verify on Etherscan.
4. Test on a testnet before mainnet minting.

Helpful tools and docs:

- Pinata: https://pinata.cloud/
- OpenSea metadata guide: https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards
- Alchemy guide for NFTs: https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-build-an-nft-application

## Conclusion

NFTs are a versatile way to represent unique digital assets. The space is evolving quickly — standards, marketplaces, and best practices continue to change. When creating or buying NFTs, consider technical robustness (metadata, contract safety), economic costs (gas, royalties), and broader societal implications.
