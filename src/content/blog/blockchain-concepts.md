# Blockchain Concepts — A Practical Conceptual Guide

Blockchain is a family of technologies that enable multiple parties to maintain a shared, tamper-evident ledger without trusting a single central authority. This guide focuses on core concepts and tradeoffs rather than implementation details.

## Ledger, blocks, and hashes

- **Ledger**: An append-only record of events (transactions). In distributed systems, a shared ledger must have a clear ordering and be auditable.
- **Block**: A container of transactions plus metadata (timestamp, previous block hash, merkle root). Blocks are linked by including the previous block's hash, producing a chain that detects tampering.
- **Hash linking**: Since each block references the previous block's hash, changing any earlier block invalidates all later hashes — making tampering evident.

## Consensus: agreeing on one history

Consensus protocols ensure that all honest nodes converge on the same ledger state. Popular approaches:

- **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**: Participants (miners) solve computational puzzles; the most-work chain is chosen. PoW provides probabilistic finality and resists censorship while requiring energy for security.
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: Validators lock up (stake) tokens and are selected to propose/validate blocks. PoS reduces energy use and supports different finality/fork-choice rules.
- **Traditional BFT algorithms** (e.g., PBFT): Used in permissioned settings where participants are known; they provide fast finality but don't scale as easily to open, permissionless networks.

Tradeoffs:

- **Finality**: PoW offers probabilistic finality (more confirmations = more certainty). BFT-style protocols offer immediate finality but often require assumptions about known participants.
- **Throughput vs decentralization**: Increasing block size or reducing block time raises throughput but can centralize participation (fewer nodes can keep up).

## Transactions, UTXO vs account models

- **UTXO (Bitcoin)**: Transactions consume unspent outputs and produce new ones. UTXO provides clear inputs/outputs and parallel validation opportunities.
- **Account model (Ethereum)**: Global accounts hold balances and contracts; transactions update account state directly. The account model is simpler for smart contracts but can be more complex for parallelization and reentrancy issues.

## Smart contracts and programmability

Smart contracts are programs stored on-chain that execute deterministically when triggered by transactions. They enable token standards, decentralized exchanges, and programmable finance, but they introduce new risks (bugs, reentrancy, economic exploits).

Design notes:

- Keep contract logic minimal and well-audited.
- Use upgradable patterns sparingly; prefer immutable contracts where possible.

## Scaling approaches

- **Layer 1 scaling**: Protocol-level improvements (sharding, optimized execution engines) that change the base chain.
- **Layer 2 scaling**: Move transactions off-chain with fraud proofs or validity proofs (rollups, state channels) while anchoring security to Layer 1.

## Security and economic incentives

Blockchains are socio-technical systems: cryptography secures messages, but incentives and governance determine long-term behavior.

- **Economic finality**: Security depends on the cost to attack (hashpower, stake). Protocols align incentives via block rewards, transaction fees, and slashing.
- **Governance**: Upgrades and parameter changes require coordination (hard forks, governance votes). Poorly managed governance can fragment communities.

## Common attacks and mitigations

- **51% / majority attacks**: When an attacker controls the majority of the resource securing consensus, they can reorder or censor blocks. Mitigation: diversify mining/validation, checkpointing, and designing for high cost of attack.
- **Smart contract exploits**: Audits, formal verification, and conservative design practices help reduce risks.
- **Network-level attacks**: Eclipse attacks, DDoS, and routing manipulation — mitigations include peer diversity, operator best practices, and monitoring.

## When to use a blockchain

Blockchain is useful when multiple parties need a shared, tamper-evident record and you cannot or do not want a single trusted intermediary. It's often overused; many systems are better served by traditional databases.

Questions to ask before choosing blockchain:

1. Do multiple independent parties need to write to the same ledger?
2. Is tamper-evidence or public auditability required?
3. Can the trust/consensus assumptions of the chosen design be met?

## Closing

Blockchain offers a set of design choices — consensus, finality, data model, and incentives — each with tradeoffs. Understanding these concepts helps you pick the right architecture or avoid using blockchain where it's unnecessary.

## Visualizations

Below are two simple visual aids that illustrate core blockchain structures. If your reader environment supports images the SVGs will render; ASCII diagrams follow as a fallback.

### Chain of blocks

![blockchain diagram](/assets/images/blockchain-diagram.svg)

ASCII fallback:

```
[Block #100]{prev=0000, merkle=a1b2}
    |
[Block #101]{prev=a1b2, merkle=e5f6}
    |
[Block #102]{prev=e5f6, merkle=9i0j}
```

### Merkle tree (proof example)

ASCII fallback (leaves hashed up to root):

```
        root = H(H(h1,h2), H(h3,h4))
         /  \
    h12      h34
    / \      / \
  h1  h2   h3  h4
```
